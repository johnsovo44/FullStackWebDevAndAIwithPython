<!--Steps:
1: Give the html page a name ("title")
2: Should have standard text with a few subheadings. They should say "Skills", "Previous work", "Rates". Have dashes in between them. Create your own text below these too.
3: Create a header that says "Portfolio Website" and this should be the biggest text
4: Give a welcome message. Something like welcome to the page and let people know what your name is.
5: for extra points add in new formatting not used yet.-->
