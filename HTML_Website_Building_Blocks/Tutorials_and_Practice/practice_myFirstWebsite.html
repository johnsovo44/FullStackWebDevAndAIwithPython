Hello World this is my first website:D HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the skeleton of a website. It contains tags that tells you what content goes where. Tim Berners-Lee created it just to share a docment about Particle Physics. Imagine creating something for a one time use and it turns into a public utility. :/
