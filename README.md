# Full Stack WebDev And AI with Python

**Course Title:**
Full Stack Web Development and Artificial Intelligence with Python

**Two motivations for doing this course:**
- I want to build web applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and python frameworks such as Django.
- I want to learn how to make my data science project interactive and responsive to a user. People should interact with data science more as a product or service, otherwise it can seem like a nebulous tool out of their reach.

The **goal** is to become a full stack web developer and a full stack data scientist. Using the course "Full Stack Web Development and AI w/ Python" helps me to achieve that by combining both disciplines into one course. In the end, I want to be able to deploy Machine Learning models online to let people interact with models and visualizations of data.

**Brief Description of the course:**
This full-stack web, Django and AI combination course leads you through a complete range of software skills and languages, skilling you up to be an incredibly on-demand developer. The combination of being able to create full-stack websites AND machine learning and AI models is very rare - something referred to as a unAIcorn. This is exactly what you will be able to do by the end of this course.

**Languages, platforms, concepts learned:**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, Pandas, Sklearn, Keras, Git, Linux, AWS
